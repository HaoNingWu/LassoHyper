# LassoHyper
This is a collection of MATLAB codes to reproduce all the figures in the paper "Lasso hyperinterpolation over general regions" by Congpei An and Haoning Wu.

This collection consists of four foulders, including Lasso hyperinterpolation on the interval, on the disc, on the sphere, and in the cube.

# Interval
To run the demo in the folder titled "Interval", you may wish to install [Chebfun](http://www.chebfun.org/) in advance, which is a great function computing toolbox developed by Oxford's Numerical Analysis Group. See http://www.chebfun.org/ for Chebfun information. We also provide Chenfun in this folder! You are recommended to ADD IT TO PATH first.

# Disc
We are very grateful to Professor Kendall E. Atkinson of the University of Iowa for providing us with MATLAB codes of disc-related experiments, which were conducted in their paper titled "On the norm of the hyperinterpolation operator on the unit disc and its use for the solution of the nonlinear Poisson equation". Our main function hyperdisc.m is written based on their M-file NonlinearElliptic.m.
