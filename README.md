# LassoHyper
This is a collection of MATLAB codes to reproduce all the figures in the paper "Lasso hyperinterpolation over general regions" by Congpei An and Haoning Wu.

This collection consists of four foulders, including Lasso hyperinterpolation on the interval, on the disc, on the sphere, and in the cube.

# Interval
To run the demo in the folder titled "Interval", you may wish to install [Chebfun](http://www.chebfun.org/) in advance, which is developed by Oxford's Numerical Analysis Group. See http://www.chebfun.org/ for Chebfun information. We also provide Chenfun in this folder! You are recommended to ADD IT TO PATH first.
